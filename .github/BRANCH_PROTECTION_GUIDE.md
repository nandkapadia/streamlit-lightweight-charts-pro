## ‚ö° Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

If you have GitHub CLI installed and authenticated:

```bash
make setup-branch-protection
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Check your GitHub CLI is authenticated
- ‚úÖ Show you what will be configured
- ‚úÖ Ask for confirmation
- ‚úÖ Apply all required status checks
- ‚úÖ Configure pull request approvals
- ‚úÖ Verify the setup succeeded

### Option 2: Manual Setup (GitHub Web UI)

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**

2. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add branch protection rule**

3. **Branch name pattern**: `main`

4. **Enable these settings:**

   **‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging**
   - Require approvals: 1
   - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - Require approval of the most recent reviewable push

   **‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - Check "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
   - Select these required checks:
     - `Test Suite (3.8)`
     - `Test Suite (3.9)`
     - `Test Suite (3.10)`
     - `Test Suite (3.11)`
     - `Test Suite (3.12)`
     - `Documentation Build`
     - `Frontend Build`
     - `Security Scan`

   **‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging**

   **‚úÖ Include administrators**

   **‚¨ú Allow force pushes** - LEAVE DISABLED

   **‚¨ú Allow deletions** - LEAVE DISABLED

5. **Click "Create"** at the bottom

> **Note**: Status checks will only appear after they've run at least once. Create a test PR first if you don't see them.

### Verify Setup

```bash
# Run verification script
make verify-ci

# Or directly:
bash scripts/verify_ci_setup.sh
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflows configured
‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks configured and installed
‚úÖ Test suite configured
‚úÖ Branch protection enabled
```

## üîí What This Protects Against

### Blocked Actions ‚ùå
- ‚úÖ Merging code with failing tests
- ‚úÖ Merging code with linting errors
- ‚úÖ Merging code with type errors
- ‚úÖ Merging code with security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Merging code without code review
- ‚úÖ Merging code with unresolved review comments
- ‚úÖ Force pushing to main branch
- ‚úÖ Deleting main branch
- ‚úÖ Merging outdated branches

### Allowed Actions ‚úÖ
- Creating feature branches
- Committing to feature branches
- Pushing to feature branches
- Creating pull requests
- Merging after all requirements met

### Merge Requirements

Before code can be merged into `main`, it MUST satisfy:

1. ‚úÖ **All Python versions tests pass** (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
2. ‚úÖ **Documentation builds successfully**
3. ‚úÖ **Frontend builds and tests pass**
4. ‚úÖ **Security scan passes** (no critical vulnerabilities)
5. ‚úÖ **Code review approved** (at least 1 approval)
6. ‚úÖ **All review comments resolved**
7. ‚úÖ **Branch is up-to-date** with main

**Total time per PR**: ~5-10 minutes for all checks

## üöÄ Developer Workflow

### Standard Development Flow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files, write code ...

# 3. Run tests locally (catches issues early)
make test-parallel        # Fast parallel testing
make format              # Auto-fix formatting
make lint                # Check code quality

# 4. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add awesome new feature"
# Pre-commit hooks run automatically and check:
# - Code formatting
# - Linting
# - Type checking
# - Basic tests

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature

# 6. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# - CI runs automatically
# - Status checks appear in PR
# - Wait for all checks to pass

# 7. Request code review
# - Tag relevant team members
# - Address any review comments

# 8. Merge!
# - Once approved + all checks pass
# - Use "Squash and merge" or "Rebase and merge"
# - Delete branch after merging
```

### If CI Checks Fail

```bash
# 1. Check which test failed (look at CI logs on GitHub)

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Run checks locally to reproduce
make test              # Run all tests
make test-parallel     # Faster with parallel execution
make lint             # Check linting issues
make format           # Auto-fix formatting issues

# 4. Fix the issues
# ... make corrections ...

# 5. Verify fixes locally
make pre-commit-run    # Run all pre-commit checks

# 6. Commit and push fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI test failures"
git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature

# CI will automatically re-run all checks
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Status Checks Don't Appear

**Solution:**
1. Create a test PR to trigger workflows
2. Wait for workflows to complete at least once
3. Return to branch protection settings
4. Status checks should now appear in the list

### Issue: Tests Pass Locally But Fail in CI

**Common Causes:**
1. **Environment Differences**: Different Python version or dependencies
2. **Missing Files**: Forgot to commit required files
3. **Timing Issues**: Race conditions in tests
4. **Cache Issues**: Stale cache in CI

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Test with same Python version as CI
conda create -n test-env python=3.11
conda activate test-env
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
pytest tests/

# Test with clean environment
make clean
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
pytest tests/

# Check for missing files
git status
git add <missing-files>
```

### Issue: Can't Merge Even Though Checks Pass

**Common Causes:**
1. **Branch Out of Date**: Need to update with latest main
2. **Conversations Not Resolved**: Review comments need addressing
3. **Missing Approvals**: Need code review approval

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Update branch with latest main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git pull origin main
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Or use GitHub UI
# - Click "Update branch" button in PR
```

### Issue: Emergency Fix Needed But Checks Are Failing

**DO NOT** disable branch protection or use force push!

**Better Approach:**
```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix

# 2. Make minimal fix
# ... fix critical issue only ...

# 3. Run tests locally
make test

# 4. If tests still fail, fix them too
# ... fix tests ...

# 5. Push and create PR
git push origin hotfix/urgent-fix

# 6. Get expedited review
# - Mark PR as urgent
# - Tag relevant reviewers
# - Explain the urgency
```

For true emergencies where main is broken:
1. Create hotfix PR following above process
2. Get approval from team lead
3. Merge as soon as checks pass
4. Post-mortem to prevent future issues

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: What if I need to make an urgent hotfix?

**A**: Follow the same process! Branch protection ensures quality, even for hotfixes:
```bash
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug
# ... make minimal fix ...
make test  # Verify it works
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug
# Create PR, get expedited review, merge when checks pass
```

### Q: Can I temporarily disable branch protection for emergency?

**A**: **NO!** Branch protection exists to prevent broken code. Instead:
- Create hotfix branch
- Fix the issue AND tests
- Get expedited review
- Merge when checks pass

### Q: What if tests pass locally but fail in CI?

**A**: Common causes:
- Different Python versions (CI tests multiple versions)
- Missing committed files
- Environment differences
- Cache issues

**Solution**: Test with clean environment:
```bash
conda create -n test-env python=3.11
conda activate test-env
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
pytest tests/
```

### Q: How long do CI checks take?

**A**: ~5-10 minutes total:
- Test Suite (each Python version): 2-5 min
- Documentation Build: 1-2 min
- Frontend Build: 2-3 min
- Security Scan: 1-2 min

Most run in parallel, so total time is ~5-10 min.

### Q: Can I skip CI checks for minor changes?

**A**: **NO!** All code must pass CI checks. "Minor changes" often introduce bugs. The checks run fast enough (~5-10 min) that skipping isn't necessary.

### Q: What if I disagree with a code review comment?

**A**: Discuss with the reviewer:
- Explain your reasoning
- Consider their perspective
- Find a compromise
- Remember: Code review improves quality

## üîí Local Pre-commit Hooks

While branch protection prevents bad code from being merged, pre-commit hooks prevent bad code from being committed locally.

### Setup Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
make pre-commit-setup

# Run hooks manually
make pre-commit-run

# Test specific categories
make pre-commit-backend        # Python checks only
make pre-commit-frontend       # Frontend checks only
make pre-commit-both          # All checks
```

### Pre-commit Hook Features

Our pre-commit hooks run:
- ‚úÖ **Code Formatting**: Ruff, Black, isort
- ‚úÖ **Linting**: Ruff, ESLint
- ‚úÖ **Type Checking**: MyPy, TypeScript
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Bandit scanning
- ‚úÖ **Tests**: Fast unit tests
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Docstring validation

**Pre-commit hooks run in seconds**, catching issues before you even push to GitHub!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Require Specific Test Categories

If you want to require specific test categories (unit, integration, e2e), update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
# Add separate jobs for each test category
unit-tests:
  name: Unit Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    # ... setup steps ...
    - name: Run unit tests
      run: pytest tests/unit/ -v -m unit

integration-tests:
  name: Integration Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    # ... setup steps ...
    - name: Run integration tests
      run: pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration
```

Then add these as required status checks in branch protection.

### Require Code Coverage Threshold

Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Check coverage threshold
  run: |
    coverage report --fail-under=95
```

### Require Performance Benchmarks

Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
performance:
  name: Performance Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    # ... setup steps ...
    - name: Run performance tests
      run: pytest tests/performance/ -v -m performance

    - name: Check performance regression
      run: |
        python scripts/check_performance_regression.py
```
